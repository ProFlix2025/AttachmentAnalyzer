🟩 Project Title:
ProFlix – Creator Video Platform (Netflix-style MVP)

📝 Description:
I'm building a Netflix-style app called ProFlix where creators upload content and viewers watch. For now, everything is free — no payment integration needed yet. The MVP should allow creators to upload videos into organized categories, and viewers to browse and watch.

👤 Users:

Viewers: Sign up, browse, and watch videos.

Creators: Sign up, upload videos, assign category/subcategory.
